### Version log

Version 1.0 (March 3, 2023): First version of the program.

Version 2.0 (April 4, 2023): A bug in the previous version was found. It only worked for zeolites with a cubic, orthorhobic or tetragonal unit cells (all angles equal to 90 degrees). This has been fixed in this version and now it works for all possible unit cells.
