State of the program:
  
  -The algorithms random and clusters work fine in all cases.
  
  -The algorithms chains and merw might fail when the Si/Al ratio is too low. This is because for many Al substitutions it can be hard to allocate the atoms stocastically while fulfilling the restraints.


Remaining in the TODO list:

  -The algorithms chains and merw should be improved so they always lead to a valid structure, or send a message when this is not possible.
