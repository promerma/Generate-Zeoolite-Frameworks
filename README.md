## Description
This repository was done as part of my Master's thesis at the MS&M group. Its main goal is to generate multiple .cif files with zeolite structures having different aluminium substitutions. The software is entirely written in C++ and contains a bash script to execute it, which requires the g++ compiler to be installed.
